## Development Guidelines

### When Creating New Games
1. Each game should be a standalone HTML file with embedded or linked JavaScript
2. Use HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
3. Maintain consistent retro/arcade aesthetic across all games
4. Ensure games are responsive and playable on different screen sizes
5. Add game cover images for the landing page gallery

## Game Development Standards

### Core Game Structure
Each game should follow this pattern:
```javascript
class Game {
    constructor(canvas) {
        this.canvas = canvas;
        this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        this.gameState = 'menu'; // menu, playing, paused, gameover
        this.score = 0;
        this.highScore = localStorage.getItem('gameName_highScore') || 0;
    }
    
    init() { /* Initialize game objects */ }
    update(deltaTime) { /* Update game logic */ }
    render() { /* Draw game state */ }
    handleInput(key, isPressed) { /* Process input */ }
}
```

### Visual Standards
- **Canvas**: 800x600 (responsive scaling)
- **Color Palette**: CSS Variables
  - `--neon-cyan: #00FFFF`
  - `--neon-magenta: #FF00FF` 
  - `--neon-yellow: #FFFF00`
  - `--neon-lime: #00FF00`
  - `--dark-bg: #0a0a0a`
  - `--dark-card: #1a1a1a`
- **Background**: Dark with subtle horizontal scanlines effect
- **Typography**: "Press Start 2P" font for authentic arcade feel
- **Effects**: Glow shadows, neon borders, hover animations

### Audio Implementation
- Use Web Audio API for retro sound synthesis
- Sound effects: beeps, boops, explosions, power-ups
- Keep sounds short and punchy (8-bit style)

### Controls
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys for movement, Space for action, ESC for navigation
- **Touch**: Virtual D-pad and action buttons for mobile (where implemented)
- **Mouse**: Game-specific controls, navigation buttons, coin insertion

## Story System & Navigation

### Character: Sal "Pixel" Martinez
- **Role**: Retired arcade owner who rebuilt his arcade using AI
- **Backstory**: Ran "Galaxy Zone" arcade from 1982, now uses AI to recreate classic games
- **Voice**: Nostalgic, knowledgeable, enthusiastic about both classic games and modern AI

### Story Structure
- **Main Story** (`how-it-was-done.html`): Complete journey with clickable game list
- **Individual Stories** (`games/*/how-i-did-it.html`): Each game's recreation story
- **Common Elements**: Sal's quotes, technical challenges, breakthrough moments

### Navigation System
- **Smart Back Buttons**: Use `window.history.back()` with fallback to appropriate page
- **ESC Key Support**: Universal back navigation on all pages  
- **Cross-Linking**: Games â†” Stories â†” Main pages all interconnected
- **Story Navigation**: From main story â†’ individual stories â†’ back to main story

### Navigation Implementation
```javascript
function goBack() {
    if (document.referrer && document.referrer.includes(window.location.hostname)) {
        window.history.back(); // Smart back to calling page
    } else {
        window.location.href = '../../index.html'; // Fallback
    }
