                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><em>"Galaga was Space Invaders' smarter, more dangerous cousin. Those aliens didn't just march in formation – they danced. They swooped and dove in beautiful arcs, turning space combat into aerial ballet."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers Galaga as the evolution of space shooters. While other games had enemies moving in predictable patterns, Galaga's aliens would break formation and dive at players in graceful, challenging arcs.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"Kids would memorize those dive patterns like sheet music. The yellow commander, the swooping escorts, the tractor beam capture – every element had its own rhythm and strategy."</em></p>

                    <p>Recreating Galaga meant capturing its sophisticated enemy AI and formation flying mechanics:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Formation Patterns</strong> - Enemies arrange in complex geometric formations</li>
                        <li><strong>Dive Attacks</strong> - Individual aliens break from formation to attack</li>
                        <li><strong>Smooth Arcs</strong> - Enemies follow curved flight paths, not straight lines</li>
                        <li><strong>Enemy Hierarchy</strong> - Different alien types with unique behaviors</li>
                        <li><strong>Capture Mechanics</strong> - Tractor beam kidnapping and rescue missions</li>
                        <li><strong>Challenging Bonus</strong> - Extra points for perfect formation shooting</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Galaga proved that enemy AI could be beautiful. Those diving patterns weren't just challenging – they were mesmerizing. Players would get hypnotized watching the formations dance."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Galaxy Raiders had boring, predictable enemies that moved in straight lines without any of Galaga's dynamic formations.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Formation Failures:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enemies moved in straight lines like Space Invaders</li>
                            <li>No formation flying or coordinated group behavior</li>
                            <li>Linear attack patterns with no curved flight paths</li>
                            <li>All enemies behaved identically regardless of type</li>
                            <li>No tractor beam or capture mechanics</li>

                    <p><em>"I watched this thing and said, 'These aren't Galaga aliens – these are Space Invaders in disguise.' Where were the beautiful dive patterns? The formation dancing? The personality?"</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's feedback was specific: <strong>"Make the aliens move like Galaga – formation flying, curved dive attacks, and those smooth arcing patterns that made the original hypnotic."</strong></p>

                    <p><em>"When I see someone playing and they pause to watch a particularly elegant dive pattern before taking their shot, I know they've found the Galaga appreciation. That's the beauty of mathematical precision in motion."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"The best space shooters teach you patience – not every shot needs to be instant. Sometimes the most satisfying victories come from waiting for the perfect moment when formation and opportunity align."</em></p>
