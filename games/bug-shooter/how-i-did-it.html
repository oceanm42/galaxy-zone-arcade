                    <p><em>"Centipede was the sniper rifle of arcade games. You had one shot, one chance to break that serpentine chain before it reached you. Miss, and that centipede just kept coming, faster and more aggressive than before."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal recalls Centipede as a masterclass in precision shooting. Players would hunker down with the trackball, making micro-adjustments to line up the perfect shot that would fragment the centipede at just the right spot.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"The beauty of Centipede was in the strategy. Do you shoot the head to stop it in its tracks? Target the middle to create multiple enemies? Or clear the mushrooms to give yourself more room? Every shot was a tactical decision."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Centipede meant capturing its unique blend of precision shooting and strategic thinking:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Segmented Enemy</strong> - Destroy parts to create multiple threats</li>
                        <li><strong>Mushroom Obstacles</strong> - Environmental barriers that affect movement</li>
                        <li><strong>Precise Shooting</strong> - Accurate cursor-based targeting</li>
                        <li><strong>Wave Progression</strong> - Increasingly complex centipede formations</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Enemy Types</strong> - Spiders, scorpions, and fleas create chaos</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Depth</strong> - Clear paths vs. fragment enemies</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Centipede taught you that sometimes the best shot isn't the obvious shot. You had to think three segments ahead, like playing chess with a serpent."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Basic Shooter Syndrome</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Bug Shooter was just another generic space shooter with no understanding of what made Centipede special.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>What Was Missing:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No segmented enemies or fragmentation mechanics</li>
                            <li>Generic straight-line enemy movement</li>
                            <li>No environmental obstacles or mushrooms</li>
                            <li>Imprecise shooting with no strategic depth</li>
                            <li>Random enemies instead of the iconic centipede</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I looked at this thing and said, 'Where's the centipede?' This was just shooting random bugs in straight lines. Centipede was never about random – it was about that beautiful, terrifying snake coming right at you."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's feedback was specific: <strong>"Make it actually be Centipede. Segmented enemy that breaks apart when shot, mushroom obstacles, precise mouse aiming."</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Mushroom Collision</strong> - Obstacles redirect centipede movement</li>
                            <li><strong>Cursor Shooting</strong> - Mouse-based precision targeting</li>
