                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><em>"Frogger was pure anxiety in arcade form. Every kid who played it understood the fundamental challenge – cross the road without getting squished. Simple concept, impossible to master, and absolutely addictive."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers Frogger as the game that taught timing and pattern recognition better than any other. Players would stand at the controls, studying traffic patterns, waiting for the perfect moment to make their move.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"I'd watch kids play Frogger and you could see them literally lean left and right, trying to will that little frog through traffic. The tension was incredible – one mistimed hop and you're roadkill."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Frogger meant capturing the precise timing mechanics that made every crossing feel like a life-or-death decision:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Grid-Based Movement</strong> - Discrete hops, not continuous movement</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Patterns</strong> - Predictable but complex vehicle flows</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-Lane Challenge</strong> - Each lane moves at different speeds</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Obstacles</strong> - Floating logs and deadly gaps</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Pressure</strong> - Race against the clock</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty</strong> - Faster traffic as levels advance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Frogger was never about quick reflexes – it was about patience, observation, and perfect timing. You had to read the patterns and find the rhythm of the road."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Smooth Movement Chaos</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Road Hopper completely missed Frogger's strategic core by using smooth, continuous movement instead of the classic grid-based hops.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Movement Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continuous movement instead of discrete grid hops</li>
                            <li>Imprecise positioning made collision detection unfair</li>
                            <li>No clear timing windows for safe crossing</li>
                            <li>Traffic moved too randomly, no learnable patterns</li>
                            <li>Players couldn't plan moves in advance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I played this thing for two minutes and said, 'This isn't Frogger – this is bumper cars.' You couldn't time anything because nothing moved with precision. Frogger was all about precision."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's direction was clear: <strong>"Make it grid-based like the original. Every hop should lock into position, and traffic patterns need to be learnable."</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>40-pixel Grid Squares</strong> - Every position is exact and predictable</li>
