                    <p><em>"Donkey Kong changed everything. Here was Mario – though we called him Jumpman then – facing impossible odds, climbing steel girders while a giant ape hurled barrels at him. It was David versus Goliath in pixel form."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers the day Donkey Kong arrived at his arcade. The line never ended. Players would crowd around, shouting warnings about incoming barrels, celebrating perfect jumps, and groaning when Mario fell just short of a platform.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"That game had drama like nothing before it. The princess at the top, the big ape laughing at you, and those relentless barrels rolling down. Every jump was life or death, every level a mountain to climb."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Donkey Kong's climbing challenge meant capturing its core platforming elements:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Multi-Level Climbing</strong> - Vertical progression through connected platforms</li>
                        <li><strong>Rolling Barrel Obstacles</strong> - Unpredictable threats requiring precise timing</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Jumping</strong> - Risk/reward decisions with every leap</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty</strong> - Faster barrels and more complex patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Ladder Navigation</strong> - Vertical movement adding tactical options</li>
                        <li><strong>Score-Based Drama</strong> - Points for jumps, height, and survival</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Donkey Kong wasn't just about jumping – it was about courage. Every time you left the safety of a platform, you were taking a leap of faith. That tension between safety and progress is what made it legendary."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Flat Jumping Game</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Barrel Jump missed the vertical climbing aspect entirely. Instead of Donkey Kong's multi-level construction site, Sal got a basic horizontal jumping game.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>What Went Wrong:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No vertical level progression</li>
                            <li>Missing ladder climbing mechanics</li>
                            <li>Barrels moved in simple, predictable patterns</li>
                            <li>No sense of climbing toward a goal</li>
                            <li>Felt more like an endless runner than Donkey Kong</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I looked at this thing running barrels across a single platform and said, 'Where's the construction site? Where's the climbing? This is missing the whole point of what made Donkey Kong special.'"</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This led to Sal's frustrated instruction: <strong>"This needs the multi-level climbing structure and ladder mechanics that made Donkey Kong iconic"</strong></p>
