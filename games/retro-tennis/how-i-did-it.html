                    <p><em>"Pong was the Big Bang of video games. Two paddles, one ball, infinite possibility. I remember the first time I saw it – people lined up just to hit a square dot back and forth. It was magic disguised as simplicity."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal recalls Pong as the foundation of everything that came after. Before Space Invaders, before Pac-Man, there was just the pure joy of interactive play – hitting a ball with perfect timing and watching your opponent scramble to return it.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"Kids today don't understand how revolutionary Pong was. Before 1972, TVs only showed you things. Pong made the TV respond to you. That was the moment entertainment became interactive."</em></p>

                    <p>Recreating Pong meant respecting its elegant simplicity while adding just enough modern polish:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Pure Physics</strong> - Ball bounces with perfect predictability</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Controls</strong> - Paddle movement feels immediate and precise</li>
                        <li><strong>Escalating Speed</strong> - Ball accelerates with each successful rally</li>
                        <li><strong>Classic Audio</strong> - Authentic electronic beeps and boops</li>

                        <li><strong>Minimalist Aesthetic</strong> - Clean lines, high contrast, zero clutter</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Pong taught the world that you don't need complex graphics or elaborate stories. Give players something that responds perfectly to their input, and they'll play forever."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Retro Tennis suffered from modern game design thinking – too many features cluttering up Pong's perfect simplicity.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Complexity Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Power-ups and special abilities ruining the pure gameplay</li>
                            <li>Fancy graphics that distracted from the core mechanics</li>
                            <li>Complicated scoring systems instead of simple points</li>
                            <li>Multiple game modes when only one was needed</li>
                            <li>Ball physics that felt floaty and unpredictable</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><em>"I looked at this overcomplicated mess and said, 'This isn't Pong – this is Pong Plus Ultra Deluxe.' Sometimes more isn't better. Sometimes perfect is just perfect."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's guidance was elegantly simple: <strong>"Strip out everything that isn't essential. Make it pure Pong – two paddles, one ball, perfect physics."</strong></p>

                        <p><em>"When the ball hits your paddle at exactly the angle you expected, with exactly the sound you anticipated, that's when you know the physics are right. Pong was never about surprises – it was about mastery."</em></p>

                        <p><em>"A good Pong rally develops its own musical rhythm. Paddle hit, ball travel, paddle hit, ball travel. Players fall into this hypnotic beat, and breaking it becomes the ultimate challenge."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><em>"Retro Tennis proves that the best games are timeless because they tap into something fundamental about play itself. Hitting a ball back and forth – that's been fun for thousands of years, and it'll be fun for thousands more."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"When I see someone playing and they settle into that focused concentration, tracking the ball with their whole body, I know they've found the Pong zone. That's the meditative state where simple becomes profound."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"Sometimes the most important lesson in game design is knowing when to stop. Pong was perfect because it knew exactly what it was and never tried to be anything else."</em></p>
