                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><em>"Joust was different from every other arcade game I'd ever seen. Knights riding flying ostriches, battling it out in mid-air – it was absolutely ridiculous and completely brilliant. The first time someone explained the concept to me, I thought they were pulling my leg."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal recalls Joust as one of the most unique games in his arcade. Players would furiously tap the flap button, trying to gain altitude advantage over their opponents, turning medieval combat into an aerial physics puzzle.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"The genius was in the momentum. You couldn't just hover – you had to constantly flap, constantly think about momentum and positioning. And that moment when you'd knock an enemy rider off their mount? Pure satisfaction."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Vision</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Joust's unique aerial combat meant capturing its distinctive physics and strategic elements:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Momentum-Based Flight</strong> - Tap to flap, gravity always pulling down</li>
                        <li><strong>Height Advantage Combat</strong> - Higher rider wins the collision</li>
                        <li><strong>Platform Navigation</strong> - Use floating platforms strategically</li>
                        <li><strong>Egg Collection Mechanics</strong> - Defeated enemies drop collectible eggs</li>
                        <li><strong>Increasing Difficulty</strong> - More enemies with better AI each wave</li>
                        <li><strong>Medieval Aesthetic</strong> - Knights, lances, and fantasy elements</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Joust wasn't just about flying – it was about controlling momentum while thinking three moves ahead. Every flap had to count, every platform could be the difference between victory and defeat."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Boring Button Masher</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Knight Flyer completely missed Joust's strategic depth. Instead of tactical aerial combat, Sal got a mindless flapping simulator.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flight felt floaty and disconnected</li>
                            <li>No height-advantage combat mechanics</li>
                            <li>Enemies were too easy and predictable</li>
                            <li>No strategic use of platforms</li>
                            <li>Missing the satisfying "jousting" collisions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I played it for two minutes and thought, 'This isn't Joust, this is some kind of flight training program.' Where was the combat? Where was the strategy? You could just hover in one spot and win."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's direct feedback: <strong>"This needs the momentum physics and height-advantage combat that made Joust legendary"</strong></p>
