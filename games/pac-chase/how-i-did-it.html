                    <p><em>"I'll never forget the day Pac-Man arrived at Galaxy Zone in 1980. The delivery truck pulled up, and I knew we had something special. Within hours, there was a line of kids wrapped around the block."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers the Pac-Man fever like it was yesterday. The distinctive <em>wakka-wakka</em> sound, the ghost chase music, the way kids would crowd around the cabinet, shouting directions at whoever was playing. It wasn't just a game – it was a phenomenon.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"Every arcade owner knew Pac-Man was the king. If you could master the patterns, you could play for hours on a single quarter. I watched kids become legends on that machine."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>When Sal decided to recreate Pac-Man for his AI Arcade, he had crystal-clear memories of what made the original magical:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>The Maze</strong> - That iconic blue maze layout, burned into every arcade kid's memory</li>
                        <li><strong>Ghost Personalities</strong> - Each ghost had to feel different, with unique AI patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Power Pellet Drama</strong> - The moment when the hunter becomes the hunted</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Timing</strong> - Grid-based movement that felt smooth but precise</li>
                        <li><strong>Sound Design</strong> - Those authentic arcade beeps and boops</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"I wanted kids today to feel that same rush I saw in 1980 – that moment when you clear a screen and the ghosts speed up for the next level."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Floating-Point Disaster</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Pac-Chase was a nightmare. The AI had created a sophisticated floating-point movement system that looked impressive in code but played terribly.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pac-Man would get stuck between maze walls</li>
                            <li>Ghosts would vibrate and glitch through corridors</li>
                            <li>Collision detection was unpredictable</li>
                            <li>The game felt sluggish and unresponsive</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I played the first version for exactly thirty seconds before shutting it down. 'This ain't Pac-Man,' I told my AI buddy. 'This is some kind of geometric nightmare.'"</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's frustration led to one of his most direct prompts: <strong>"pac chase does nothing. redo this game correctly. think"</strong></p>

            <section class="story-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Solution: Back to Basics</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The breakthrough came when Sal demanded a complete rebuild using the fundamentals he remembered from the original arcade hardware.</p>
                    
                    <div class="tech-highlight">
                        <h4>Key Technical Decisions:</h4>
                        <ul class="tech-list">
                            <li><strong>Grid-Based Movement</strong> - 31x23 tile grid, just like the original</li>
                            <li><strong>Integer Coordinates</strong> - No floating-point bugs, pure grid logic</li>
                            <li><strong>Timing Control</strong> - Player moves every 8 frames, ghosts every 10</li>
                            <li><strong>Hand-Crafted Maze</strong> - Traditional Pac-Man layout in string format</li>
                            <li><strong>Simple AI Patterns</strong> - Chase with 80% targeting, 20% randomness</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"Sometimes the old ways are the only ways that work. Those 1980 arcade programmers knew what they were doing – tight constraints, simple math, perfect timing."</em></p>

                    <p><em>"The second version of Pac-Chase felt right from the first move. Smooth, responsive, just like I remembered. The AI nailed it by going back to the fundamentals instead of overcomplicating things."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"When I see someone play Pac-Chase and instinctively try to cut corners or lead ghosts into a trap, I know we got it right. The muscle memory from 1980 still works in 2025."</em></p>
