                    <p><em>"Breakout was pure arcade genius – take Pong, add a wall of bricks, and suddenly you have something magical. I watched kids spend hours perfecting their paddle control, learning exactly where to hit the ball to get those satisfying corner shots."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers Breakout as one of the most addictive games in his arcade. The simple concept – bounce a ball to destroy bricks – hid layers of strategy and skill that kept players coming back for "just one more game."</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"The sound of bricks breaking, that satisfying pop-pop-pop when you got the ball stuck in the upper corner, and the panic when the ball came screaming back at you – that's arcade perfection in its purest form."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Creating the perfect Breakout clone meant nailing the fundamentals that made the original so compelling:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Precise Ball Physics</strong> - Predictable angles for skill-based gameplay</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Paddle Control</strong> - Smooth movement that feels connected</li>
                        <li><strong>Colorful Brick Patterns</strong> - Visual hierarchy showing point values</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty</strong> - Ball speed increases with each level</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Angles</strong> - Reward players for skilled positioning</li>
                        <li><strong>Satisfying Audio</strong> - Every brick break needs to feel rewarding</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Breakout looks simple, but getting the physics right is everything. The ball has to behave exactly as players expect, or the whole illusion falls apart."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Brick Breaker had physics that felt completely wrong. The ball would behave unpredictably, making the game frustrating instead of fun.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Physics Problems:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ball angles changed randomly on paddle hits</li>
                            <li>Brick collisions sent the ball in wrong directions</li>
                            <li>Ball would get stuck in infinite loops</li>
                            <li>Paddle control felt sluggish and unresponsive</li>
                            <li>No way to put "english" on the ball</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><em>"I played it for about five minutes and wanted to throw the paddle through the screen. The ball was doing whatever it wanted, not what I was telling it to do. That's not Breakout – that's chaos."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's feedback was direct: <strong>"Fix the ball physics. Players need to feel in control, not at the mercy of random bounces."</strong></p>
