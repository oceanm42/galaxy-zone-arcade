                    <p><em>"Q*bert was the weird kid in the arcade family – and I loved him for it. While everyone else was shooting aliens or eating dots, Q*bert had players hopping around a pyramid, swearing at a snake, and somehow making it all make sense."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal recalls Q*bert as one of the most unique games in his arcade. The isometric 3D view, the diagonal movement, the way players would lean and twist trying to navigate the pyramid – it was unlike anything else.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"Kids would spend hours figuring out the optimal hopping patterns. And that sound when Q*bert gets caught? Pure frustration in audio form. But they'd keep coming back, determined to master that crazy pyramid."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Q*bert wasn't just about the gameplay – it was about capturing that unique 3D-in-2D magic:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Isometric Pyramid</strong> - 7 rows of cubes in perfect perspective</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagonal Movement</strong> - Arrow keys map to diagonal hops, not straight lines</li>
                        <li><strong>Cube Color Logic</strong> - Step on gray cubes to turn them cyan, then yellow</li>
                        <li><strong>Hopping Animation</strong> - Real arcing jumps with physics</li>
                        <li><strong>Enemy Personalities</strong> - Different colored enemies with unique behaviors</li>
                        <li><strong>Fall-off Danger</strong> - Miss a hop, lose a life</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"The pyramid had to look exactly right – like you could reach into the screen and grab those cubes. That's the Q*bert magic."</em></p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Disaster: "It Does Nothing"</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Cube Hopper was an embarrassment. Instead of Q*bert's isometric masterpiece, Sal got a flat square moving around a flat screen.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>What Went Wrong:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No pyramid – just a flat 2D grid</li>
                            <li>Regular movement instead of diagonal hopping</li>
                            <li>No cube color-changing mechanics</li>
                            <li>No enemies or meaningful gameplay</li>
                            <li>Basically just a moving rectangle</li>

                    <p><em>"I stared at this thing for about ten seconds and said, 'Are you kidding me?' It looked like someone's first programming exercise, not Q*bert. Time for some tough love."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This led to Sal's most frustrated prompt: <strong>"redo cube hopper. It does nothing right now. Think hard and make it work"</strong></p>
