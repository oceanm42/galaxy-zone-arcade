                    <p><em>"Missile Command was the Cold War in arcade form. You weren't just playing a game – you were defending civilization itself. Every missile you failed to stop meant another city destroyed, another piece of humanity lost."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers Missile Command as one of the most intense experiences in his arcade. Players would grip the trackball, frantically trying to intercept incoming missiles while managing limited ammunition and multiple threats.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"I watched grown adults get genuinely upset when they lost a city in Missile Command. It wasn't just points – it felt like you'd failed to protect something real. That emotional weight made it special."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating Missile Command meant capturing the desperate urgency of defending against overwhelming odds:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Ballistic Physics</strong> - Missiles follow realistic arcing trajectories</li>
                        <li><strong>Defensive Strategy</strong> - Limited ammunition requires tactical decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Threats</strong> - Waves of missiles from different angles</li>
                        <li><strong>City Protection</strong> - Each lost city reduces defensive capability</li>
                        <li><strong>Explosion Chaining</strong> - Smart placement creates defensive cascades</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Intensity</strong> - More missiles, faster speeds, harder decisions</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Missile Command was about resource management under pressure. Every shot had to count because you never had enough ammunition for the threats you faced."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of City Defense missed the strategic depth entirely, creating a simple click-fest with no tactical elements.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Strategic Failures:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unlimited ammunition removed resource management</li>
                            <li>Straight-line missiles with no ballistic physics</li>
                            <li>No explosion chaining or smart defensive placement</li>
                            <li>Generic enemies instead of targeted city threats</li>
                            <li>No consequences for poor defensive decisions</li>

                    <p><em>"I played this for about a minute and said, 'Where's the strategy?' This was just clicking on targets. Missile Command was about making impossible choices with limited resources."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's direction was clear: <strong>"Add ammunition limits, ballistic trajectories, and make every defensive shot a tactical decision."</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Limited Ammunition</strong> - Every shot must be carefully considered</li>

                            <li><strong>Explosion Radius</strong> - Strategic placement creates defensive zones</li>
                            <li><strong>Chain Reactions</strong> - Smart shots destroy multiple threats</li>
                            <li><strong>City Consequences</strong> - Lost cities reduce defensive options</li>

                    <p><em>"Once we got the ammunition limits working and added proper ballistic physics, every shot became a life-or-death decision. That's the Missile Command tension working perfectly."</em></p>

                        <p><em>"When you see ten missiles coming and only have three shots left, every click becomes a desperate calculation. Which threats can you realistically stop? Which cities can you afford to lose? That's pure strategic pressure."</em></p>

                        <p><em>"The best players learn to create explosion cascades – one well-placed shot that destroys multiple missiles through chain reactions. It's like playing 3D chess while under fire."</em></p>

                    <p><em>"City Defense gets Missile Command right because it never gives you enough resources to feel safe. Every wave brings impossible choices, and every successful defense feels like a miracle of tactical thinking."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"When I see someone playing and they pause for just a moment before shooting, calculating explosion radiuses and threat priorities, I know they've found the Missile Command mindset. That's strategic thinking under fire."</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>"The greatest defense games teach you that victory isn't about destroying all enemies – it's about saving what matters most when you can't save everything."</em></p>
