                    <p><em>"Asteroids was pure physics poetry. No other arcade game taught you Newton's laws quite like piloting that little triangle through an asteroid field. Every thrust, every rotation, every momentum-based collision was a lesson in space dynamics."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal recalls Asteroids as the thinking person's space game. Players had to master not just shooting, but momentum, inertia, and the art of controlled flight in a frictionless environment.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"I'd watch kids play and you could see the exact moment when they 'got' the physics. Suddenly they'd stop fighting the ship and start dancing with it, using momentum like a tool instead of wrestling against it."</em></p>

                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Newtonian Physics</strong> - Objects in motion stay in motion</li>
                        <li><strong>Momentum-Based Flight</strong> - Thrust doesn't move you, it accelerates you</li>
                        <li><strong>Screen Wrapping</strong> - The classic asteroid field is infinite</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragment Dynamics</strong> - Large asteroids split into smaller ones</li>

                    <p><em>"Asteroids wasn't about quick reflexes – it was about thinking three moves ahead. You had to plan your trajectory, manage your momentum, and always know where your ship was heading next."</em></p>

                    <p>The first version of Asteroid Blaster felt like driving a car instead of piloting a spacecraft. The physics were completely wrong.</p>

                            <li>Collisions had no realistic impact on movement</li>

                    <p><em>"I took one look at this thing and said, 'This isn't space – this is underwater driving.' The ship was moving like it had brakes and friction. That's not how Asteroids worked."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's feedback cut right to the core: <strong>"The physics are wrong. Make it feel like you're really floating in space with real momentum."</strong></p>
