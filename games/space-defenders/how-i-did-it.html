                <div class="story-text">
                    <p><em>"Space Invaders was the game that made me believe in the arcade business. When it hit in 1978, it wasn't just popular – it was a cultural phenomenon. I had to order extra coin boxes because people were playing it so much the machines couldn't hold all the quarters."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal remembers Space Invaders as the game that defined what video games could be. The simple concept – defend Earth from descending alien invaders – created a tension that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"That descending rhythm, getting faster and faster as you eliminated enemies, the way your heart would race when the invaders got close to the bottom – that was pure adrenaline in digital form. No game before it had ever made people feel that desperate urgency."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Recreating the Space Invaders magic meant understanding what made the original so compelling:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="vision-list">
                        <li><strong>Formation Flying Enemies</strong> - Neat rows that become chaotic as you fight</li>
                        <li><strong>Accelerating Pressure</strong> - Fewer enemies means faster, more dangerous movement</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Cover</strong> - Destructible barriers that degrade over time</li>
                        <li><strong>Precision Shooting</strong> - One shot on screen, make it count</li>
                        <li><strong>Mystery UFO</strong> - Bonus targets for skilled players</li>
                        <li><strong>Rising Tension</strong> - The closer they get, the more desperate you become</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><em>"Space Invaders worked because it was humanity's last stand distilled into pure gameplay. Every shot mattered, every enemy eliminated bought you precious time, and every wave survived felt like saving the world."</em></p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>The first version of Space Defenders completely missed what made Space Invaders special. Instead of methodical formation-breaking strategy, Sal got a chaotic bullet-hell game.</p>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h4>The Fatal Flaws:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enemies moved randomly instead of in formation</li>
                            <li>Multiple bullets allowed, removing shot precision</li>
                            <li>No acceleration as enemies were eliminated</li>
                            <li>Missing the iconic barrier/cover system</li>
                            <li>No sense of mounting pressure or desperation</li>

                    <p><em>"I watched this thing for thirty seconds and knew it was wrong. The enemies were flying all over like a swarm of bees. Space Invaders was about order becoming chaos, not chaos from the start."</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Sal's direct instruction: <strong>"This needs the formation movement and accelerating pressure that made Space Invaders legendary"</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Speed Acceleration</strong> - Movement speed increases as enemies are eliminated</li>
                            <li><strong>Destructible Barriers</strong> - Cover that degrades with damage</li>
                            <li><strong>Bottom Line Defeat</strong> - Immediate game over if enemies reach the ground</li>

                    <p><em>"Space Defenders gets Space Invaders right because it understands that the game was never about aliens – it was about pressure.
